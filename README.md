## Dreamer v3 - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04104v1">Dreamer v3</a> in Pytorch<a href="https://danijar.com/project/dreamerv3/">(a webpage of results)</a>, first neural network to be able to collect diamonds in the game of Minecraft, without any pretraining.

Update: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfpZu0R1s1Y">Edan Meyer</a> has uncovered that the authors increased the speed at which the blocks break in Minecraft, so it may not be a fair comparison to previous work.
